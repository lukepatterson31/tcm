### AV Evasion and Persistence with Metasploit

Leave the System cmd prompt open after initial privesc

Load the exploit/multi/script/web_delivery module in msfconsole

Set the target to PowerShell, LHOST, LPORT, payload, etc.

Execute the exploit with `run -j` to run it as a job

Paste the generated PowerShell command into the System cmd prompt and run it

This gives a reverse meterpreter System shell

We can use exploit/windows/local/persistence to set up persistence on boot

Start a multi/handler and reboot the target, this should trigger the persistence and give us a reverse shell
